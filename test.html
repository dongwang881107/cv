              <h2>Biograph</h2>
            <p>I am a research scientist at Google Brain working at the intersection of machine learning and computer security. My most recent line of work studies properties of neural networks from an adversarial perspective. I received my Ph.D. from UC Berkeley in 2018, and my B.A. in computer science and mathematics (also from UC Berkeley) in 2013.</p>
      
            <p>
              Generally, I am interested in developing attacks on machine learning systems; most of my work develops attacks demonstrating security and privacy risks of these systems.
              I have received best paper awards at ICML and IEEE S&amp;P, and my work has been featured in
